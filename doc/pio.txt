INTRODUCTION                                    *pio*

This is a collection of helper commands for VIM to ease the use of
PlatformIO with VIM.

COMMANDS                                        *pio-commands*

The commands are the core of the plugin, allowing for basic control
of PlatformIO projects.

                                                *pio-:PIO*
:PIO [args]               Works like the shell command, uses a single
                          term window.

                                                *:PIONewProject*
:PIONewProject [args]     Creates a new PlatformIO project, shows a list of
                          boards to select from. You can supply search terms
                          to limit the board list, e.g. 'esp32'.

                          This will also create a Makefile as well as a
                          main.cpp file in the src folder.

                                                *:PIOAddLibrary*
:PIOAddLibrary {args}     Shows a list of available libraries based on the
                          supplied search terms. Press <CR> on a name to 
                          install that library.

                          If searching for libraries takes too long you can
                          cancel the search with <Ctrl-C> and see the results
                          that were found already.

                                                *:PIORemoveLibrary*
:PIORemoveLibrary         Shows a list of installed libraries, press <CR> on
                          a name to uninstall that library.

                                                *:PIOInit*
:PIOInit {args}           Creates a new project with the selected board name,
                          supports auto-completion of the name.

                                                *:PIOInstall*
:PIOInstall {args}        Installs a library by name or id, supports auto-
                          completion of the name. No list is displayed.

                                                *:PIOUninstall*
:PIOUninstall {args}      Removes a library from the project, supports auto-
                          completion of the name. No list is displayed.

                                                *:PIORefresh*
:PIORefresh               Creates a new project with the selected board name,
                          supports auto-completion of the name.


MAKEFILE                                        *pio-Makefile*
 
The plugin creates a `Makefile` for the project with the following targets:
- `all` (default)
- `upload`
- `clean`
- `program`
- `uploadfs`

This way you can use a simple `:make upload` to compile and upload your code
to your microcontroller.

OTHER                                           *pio-other*

Code completion~
To get code completion please install ccls and a vim plugin to handle
language servers (e.g. coc-nvim).
